# ESC190

This is a compilation of Labs done in ESC190 Computer Algorithms & Data Structures source. Labs are done in **C** and some **Python**.  

#

### Lab 1: Insertion Sort
- This lab practiced basic functions of C including writing an intertion sort.
  
### Lab 2: Linked Lists
- This lab practiced being familiarized with the linked list structure.

### Lab 3: Strings
- This lab implemented several string related functions in C.

### Lab 4: Linked Lists 2
- This lab practice the use of header files to implement linked lists and wrote a sort function with a complexity of O(log(n))


### Lab 5: BFS, DFS, and Dijskstra
- This lab implemented the **breadth first search**, **depth first search**, and a slower version of the **Dijskstra Algorithm**. 


### Lab 6: Binary Trees, BFS
- This lab defines a **binary search tree**, finds its height, and prints it out using **breadth first search**.


### Lab 7: Images and Pixels
- This lab practices working with image files and pixels in C.

### Lab 8: AVL Tree
- This lab practices working with **AVL Trees** and compares it to **BST**s.
